pos,"an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length ."
neg,an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
pos,the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of .

pos,"all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow ."
neg,"diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused ."
pos,two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy .
neg,"not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best ."
