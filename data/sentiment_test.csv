pos,"wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin ."

neg,the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth .
pos,"it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more ."

neg,"kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world ."
pos,"for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama ."
pos,"it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least ."

neg, . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
pos,"the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits ."
